## Nobel-Laureates-Data-Visualization

This project is a Python-based data exploration and visualization of Nobel laureates, using data sourced from nobelprize.org in JSON format. The main goal of this project is to extract insights from the data and create visualizations using Tableau.

The project utilizes Python libraries to extract and preprocess the data from the JSON file, and then uses Tableau to visualize the data. The extracted data includes information on the Nobel laureates, such as their name, nationality, year of award, category of award, and the reason for their award.
