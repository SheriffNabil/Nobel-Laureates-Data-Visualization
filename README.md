# Visual History of Nobel Prize Laureates: A Tableau Dashboard

## Introduction

Welcome to the *Visual History of Nobel Prize Laureates* project! This project leverages Python for data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing of the comprehensive list of Nobel laureates, with data sourced from the official Nobel Prize API (https://api.nobelprize.org/2.1/laureates?limit=20000000) in JSON format. Our primary objective is to uncover valuable insights and trends from this rich dataset and present them through an interactive Tableau dashboard.

**Tableau Dashboard: Nobel Laureates Data Visualization (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sherifnabil/viz/AVisualHistoryofNobelPrizeLaureantes/Main)**

In this project, you will find:

1. Python scripts for downloading, preprocessing, and transforming the raw Nobel laureates data into a structured format suitable for visualization.
2. Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify interesting patterns, trends, and relationships in the data.
3. A polished and interactive Tableau dashboard that showcases the visual history of Nobel Prize laureates, highlighting various aspects such as laureates' demographics, prize categories, and noteworthy achievements.

This project serves as an excellent resource for anyone interested in understanding the history and impact of Nobel Prize laureates or looking to dive into data visualization using Tableau. The combination of Python and Tableau provides a powerful, flexible, and user-friendly solution for presenting complex data in an engaging and informative manner.
